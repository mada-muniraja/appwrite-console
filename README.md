# Appwrite Console Cross-Platform App

This is an unofficial cross-platform app for [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io/) made with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/).

The app is a simple wrapper around the Appwrite console web interface, allowing you to access the console from a native application on any operating system.

## Build the app using source

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required tools using `cargo install tauri-cli` and `npm install`.
3. Build the frontend by executing `npm run build`.
4. Compile the application with `npx tauri build`.
