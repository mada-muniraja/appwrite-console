# Appwrite Console Desktop App

This is an unofficial desktop app for [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io/) console made with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/).

The app is a simple wrapper around the Appwrite console web interface, allowing you to access the console from a native desktop app.

## Build the app using source

1. Clone the repository and change into the directory.
2. Install the dependencies with `cargo install tauri-cli` and `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run build` to build the frontend.
4. Run `npx tauri build` to build the app.
